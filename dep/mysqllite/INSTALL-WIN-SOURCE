2.5.9. Installing MySQL from Source on Windows

   These instructions describe how to build binaries from source for
   MySQL 5.1 on Windows. Instructions are provided for building
   binaries from a standard source distribution or from the Bazaar
   tree that contains the latest development source.

Note

   The instructions here are strictly for users who want to test
   MySQL on Microsoft Windows from the latest source distribution or
   from the Bazaar tree. For production use, we do not advise using a
   MySQL server built by yourself from source. Normally, it is best
   to use precompiled binary distributions of MySQL that are built
   specifically for optimal performance on Windows by Oracle
   Corporation. Instructions for installing binary distributions are
   available in Section 2.5, "Installing MySQL on Windows."

   To build MySQL on Windows from source, you must satisfy the
   following system, compiler, and resource requirements:

     * Windows 2000, Windows XP, or newer version.
       Windows Vista is supported when using Visual Studio 2005
       provided you have installed the following updates:

          + Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition - ENU
            Service Pack 1 (KB926601)
            (http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=926601)

          + Security Update for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
            Professional Edition - ENU (KB937061)
            (http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=937061)

          + Update for Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Professional
            Edition - ENU (KB932232)
            (http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=932232)

     * CMake, which can be downloaded from http://www.cmake.org.
       After installing, modify your path to include the cmake
       binary.

     * Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition, Visual Studio .Net
       2003 (7.1), or Visual Studio 2005 (8.0) compiler system.

     * If you are using Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition, you must
       also install an appropriate Platform SDK. More information and
       links to downloads for various Windows platforms is available
       from
       http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0baf2
       b35-c656-4969-ace8-e4c0c0716adb.

     * If you are compiling from a Bazaar tree or making changes to
       the parser, you need bison for Windows, which can be
       downloaded from
       http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm. Download
       the package labeled "Complete package, excluding sources".
       After installing the package, modify your path to include the
       bison binary and ensure that this binary is accessible from
       Visual Studio.

     * Cygwin might be necessary if you want to run the test script
       or package the compiled binaries and support files into a Zip
       archive. (Cygwin is needed only to test or package the
       distribution, not to build it.) Cygwin is available from
       http://cygwin.com.

     * 3GB to 5GB of disk space.

   The exact system requirements for Visual Studio can be found here:
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/Previous/2003/sysreqs/default.as
   px and
   http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/products/sysreqs/default.aspx

   You also need a MySQL source distribution for Windows, which can
   be obtained two ways:

     * Obtain a source distribution packaged by Oracle Corporation.
       These are available from http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/.

     * Package a source distribution yourself from the latest Bazaar
       developer source tree. For instructions on pulling the latest
       source files, see Section 2.3.3, "Installing from the
       Development Source Tree."

   If you find something not working as expected, or you have
   suggestions about ways to improve the current build process on
   Windows, please send a message to the win32 mailing list. See
   Section 1.6.1, "MySQL Mailing Lists."

2.5.9.1. Building MySQL from Source Using CMake and Visual Studio

   You can build MySQL on Windows by using a combination of cmake and
   Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003 (7.1), Microsoft Visual Studio
   2005 (8.0), Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (9.0) or Microsoft Visual
   C++ 2005 Express Edition. You must have the appropriate Microsoft
   Platform SDK installed.

Note

   To compile from the source code on Windows you must use the
   standard source distribution (for example, mysql-5.1.50.tar.gz).
   You build from the same distribution as used to build MySQL on
   Unix, Linux and other platforms. Do not use the Windows Source
   distributions as they do not contain the necessary configuration
   script and other files.

   Follow this procedure to build MySQL:

    1. If you are installing from a packaged source distribution,
       create a work directory (for example, C:\workdir), and unpack
       the source distribution there using WinZip or another Windows
       tool that can read .zip files. This directory is the work
       directory in the following instructions.

Note
       You must run the commands in the win directory from the
       top-level source directory. Do not change into the win
       directory, as the commands will not be executed correctly.

    2. Start a command shell. If you have not configured the PATH and
       other environment variables for all command shells, you may be
       able to start a command shell from the Start Menu within the
       Windows Visual Studio menu that contains the necessary
       environment changes.

    3. Within the command shell, navigate to the work directory and
       run the following command:
C:\workdir>win\configure.js options
       If you have associated the .js file extension with an
       application such as a text editor, then you may need to use
       the following command to force configure.js to be executed as
       a script:
C:\workdir>cscript win\configure.js options
       These options are available for configure.js:

          + WITH_INNOBASE_STORAGE_ENGINE: Enable the InnoDB storage
            engine.

          + WITH_PARTITION_STORAGE_ENGINE: Enable user-defined
            partitioning.

          + WITH_ARCHIVE_STORAGE_ENGINE: Enable the ARCHIVE storage
            engine.

          + WITH_BLACKHOLE_STORAGE_ENGINE: Enable the BLACKHOLE
            storage engine.

          + WITH_EXAMPLE_STORAGE_ENGINE: Enable the EXAMPLE storage
            engine.

          + WITH_FEDERATED_STORAGE_ENGINE: Enable the FEDERATED
            storage engine.

          + WITH_NDBCLUSTER_STORAGE_ENGINE: Enable the NDBCLUSTER
            storage engine in the MySQL server; cause binaries for
            the MySQL Cluster management and data node, management
            client, and other programs to be built.
            This option is supported only in MySQL Cluster NDB 7.0
            (NDBCLUSTER storage engine versions 6.4.0 and later)
            using the MySQL Cluster sources. It cannot be used to
            enable clustering support in other MySQL source trees or
            distributions.

          + MYSQL_SERVER_SUFFIX=suffix: Server suffix, default none.

          + COMPILATION_COMMENT=comment: Server comment, default
            "Source distribution".

          + MYSQL_TCP_PORT=port: Server port, default 3306.

          + DISABLE_GRANT_OPTIONS: Disables the --bootstrap,
            --skip-grant-tables, and --init-file options for mysqld.
            This option is available as of MySQL 5.1.15.
       For example (type the command on one line):
C:\workdir>win\configure.js WITH_INNOBASE_STORAGE_ENGINE
             WITH_PARTITION_STORAGE_ENGINE MYSQL_SERVER_SUFFIX=-pro

    4. From the work directory, execute the win\build-vs9.bat
       (Windows Visual Studio 2008), win\build-vs8.bat (Windows
       Visual Studio 2005), or win\build-vs71.bat (Windows Visual
       Stidion 2003) script, depending on the version of Visual
       Studio you have installed. The script invokes CMake, which
       generates the mysql.sln solution file.
       You can also use the corresponding 64-bit file (for example
       win\build-vs8_x64.bat or win\build-vs9_x64.bat) to build the
       64-bit version of MySQL. However, you cannot build the 64-bit
       version with Visual Studio Express Edition. You must use
       Visual Studio 2005 (8.0) or higher.

    5. From the work directory, open the generated mysql.sln file
       with Visual Studio and select the proper configuration using
       the Configuration menu. The menu provides Debug, Release,
       RelwithDebInfo, MinRelInfo options. Then select Solution >
       Build to build the solution.
       Remember the configuration that you use in this step. It is
       important later when you run the test script because that
       script needs to know which configuration you used.

    6. Test the server. The server built using the preceding
       instructions expects that the MySQL base directory and data
       directory are C:\mysql and C:\mysql\data by default. If you
       want to test your server using the source tree root directory
       and its data directory as the base directory and data
       directory, you need to tell the server their path names. You
       can either do this on the command line with the --basedir and
       --datadir options, or by placing appropriate options in an
       option file. (See Section 4.2.3.3, "Using Option Files.") If
       you have an existing data directory elsewhere that you want to
       use, you can specify its path name instead.
       When the server is running in standalone fashion or as a
       service based on your configuration, try to connect to it from
       the mysql interactive command-line utility.
       You can also run the standard test script, mysql-test-run.pl.
       This script is written in Perl, so you'll need either Cygwin
       or ActiveState Perl to run it. You may also need to install
       the modules required by the script. To run the test script,
       change location into the mysql-test directory under the work
       directory, set the MTR_VS_CONFIG environment variable to the
       configuration you selected earlier (or use the --vs-config
       option), and invoke mysql-test-run.pl. For example (using
       Cygwin and the bash shell):
shell> cd mysql-test
shell> export MTR_VS_CONFIG=debug
shell> ./mysql-test-run.pl --force --timer
shell> ./mysql-test-run.pl --force --timer --ps-protocol

   When you are satisfied that the programs you have built are
   working correctly, stop the server. Now you can install the
   distribution. One way to do this is to use the make_win_bin_dist
   script in the scripts directory of the MySQL source distribution
   (see Section 4.4.2, "make_win_bin_dist --- Package MySQL
   Distribution as ZIP Archive"). This is a shell script, so you must
   have Cygwin installed if you want to use it. It creates a Zip
   archive of the built executables and support files that you can
   unpack in the location at which you want to install MySQL.

   It is also possible to install MySQL by copying directories and
   files directly:

    1. Create the directories where you want to install MySQL. For
       example, to install into C:\mysql, use these commands:
C:\> mkdir C:\mysql
C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\bin
C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\data
C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\share
C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\scripts
       If you want to compile other clients and link them to MySQL,
       you should also create several additional directories:
C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\include
C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\lib
C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\lib\debug
C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\lib\opt
       If you want to benchmark MySQL, create this directory:
C:\> mkdir C:\mysql\sql-bench
       Benchmarking requires Perl support. See Section 2.15, "Perl
       Installation Notes."

    2. From the work directory, copy into the C:\mysql directory the
       following files and directories:
C:\> cd \workdir
C:\workdir> mkdir C:\mysql
C:\workdir> mkdir C:\mysql\bin
C:\workdir> copy client\Release\*.exe C:\mysql\bin
C:\workdir> copy sql\Release\mysqld.exe C:\mysql\bin\mysqld.exe
C:\workdir> xcopy scripts\*.* C:\mysql\scripts /E
C:\workdir> xcopy share\*.* C:\mysql\share /E
       If you want to compile other clients and link them to MySQL,
       you should also copy several libraries and header files:
C:\workdir> copy lib\Release\mysqlclient.lib C:\mysql\lib\debug
C:\workdir> copy lib\Release\libmysql.* C:\mysql\lib\debug
C:\workdir> copy lib\Release\zlib.* C:\mysql\lib\debug
C:\workdir> copy lib\Release\mysqlclient.lib C:\mysql\lib\opt
C:\workdir> copy lib\Release\libmysql.* C:\mysql\lib\opt
C:\workdir> copy lib\Release\zlib.* C:\mysql\lib\opt
C:\workdir> copy include\*.h C:\mysql\include
C:\workdir> copy libmysql\libmysql.def C:\mysql\include

Note
       If you have compiled a Debug, rather than Release solution,
       you can replace Release with Debug in the source file names
       shown above.
       If you want to benchmark MySQL, you should also do this:
C:\workdir> xcopy sql-bench\*.* C:\mysql\bench /E

   After installation, set up and start the server in the same way as
   for binary Windows distributions. This includes creating the
   system tables by running mysql_install_db. For more information,
   see Section 2.5, "Installing MySQL on Windows."
